## How it works

The Website consists of a header, a hero, 7 different sections and a footer at the bottom.

A notification bar can be shown at the top of the website to show the number of days until the next event will take place. This notification bar can be activated in the cms

By clicking a link in the main menu the website automatically scrolls to the relevant section. The menu moves along with scrolling. So if you scroll on to a next section, this next section will automatically be highlighted in the main menu

As mentioned earlier, with the dropdown menu in the main menu, different years of the website can be loaded. For each section, a year and his content is filled in in the cms. 

The order and content of the sections can all be adjusted in the cms. The locations and the agendas of the event are custom post types which are automatically entered in the website after addition.

The section that shows the partners is a swiper and automatically swipes after a couple of seconds. The agenda items show a photo when you hover over them. Videos can be viewed by year by simply clicking them in the toggle menu in the section
